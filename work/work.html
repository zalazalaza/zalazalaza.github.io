      focused on providing more sustainable choices for common landscaping needs while pushing the boundries of normative culture and its standards further outward.
      while the backbone of my business is building good soil for lawns and gardens i grow ever more interested in the less conventional. make no mistake though,
      it is a simple landscaping business where most involved are still humble enough to take pride in a a nicely mowed lawn or just digging a proper hole.
      in addition this small landscaping business is not simply organic because of the materials we choose not to use but also seeks to provide a route to greater
      autonomy for all individuals that work with or for Green Wheel LLC.  A range of cohorts from recent high school graduates and current college students
      to established artists seeking to add interest, color, and character to your personal space.
